In Docker, **port mapping** allows you to expose ports from a container to the host machine. This lets services running inside containers be accessible from outside the container, such as from a browser or a network request.

When you run a Docker container, you can map ports using the `-p` or `--publish` flag. The general syntax for port mapping is:

```
docker run -p <host-port>:<container-port> <image-name>
```

### Example:

```
docker run -p 8080:80 nginx
```

This command maps port **80** (default HTTP port in the Nginx container) to **8080** on the host machine. After running this command, you can access the web service running inside the container by visiting `http://localhost:8080` on your host machine.

### Key Points:
- **Host Port**: The port on your machine that will be exposed (e.g., `8080`).
- **Container Port**: The port inside the container that the application is listening on (e.g., `80` for HTTP).
- Docker uses the host machine's port to redirect incoming traffic to the containerâ€™s port.

### Multiple Port Mappings:
You can also map multiple ports by specifying `-p` multiple times:

```
docker run -p 8080:80 -p 3306:3306 mysql
```

This maps:
- Host port `8080` to container port `80` (for HTTP).
- Host port `3306` to container port `3306` (for MySQL).

### Random Port Mapping:
If you don't specify the host port, Docker will choose a random one for you:

```
docker run -p 8080 nginx
```

This maps **port 80** inside the container to a random available port on the host, which you can find by running `docker ps` and looking for the `PORTS` column.

In Docker, **volume mapping** (or **mounting volumes**) allows you to persist data from a container to your host machine, or share data between containers. Volumes are especially useful for storing data that needs to persist across container restarts or when you want to share data between containers.

### Syntax for Volume Mapping

When you run a Docker container, you can use the `-v` or `--volume` flag to map a directory or file from the host to a directory inside the container.

The general syntax is:

```
docker run -v <host-path>:<container-path>
```

### Example 1: Mapping a Host Directory to a Container Directory
If you want to map a host directory to a container directory, you can do something like this:

```
docker run -v /path/on/host:/path/in/container my-image
```

This will mount `/path/on/host` from your host system into `/path/in/container` inside the container.

**Example**:

```
docker run -v /home/user/data:/app/data my-image
```

This command will mount the `/home/user/data` directory from the host into the `/app/data` directory inside the container. Any changes to the `/app/data` directory inside the container will be reflected in `/home/user/data` on the host, and vice versa.

### Example 2: Using Named Volumes

Named volumes are useful because Docker will manage them for you (creating, storing, and backing them up) without needing to specify a specific host path.

```
docker run -v my-volume:/app/data my-image
```

In this example:
- `my-volume` is a named volume that Docker will automatically create.
- `/app/data` is the directory inside the container where the volume will be mounted.

You can later inspect and manage this volume using Docker commands, and data will persist even if the container is removed.

### Example 3: Read-Only Volumes

You can make a volume read-only by adding `:ro` to the mapping:

```
docker run -v /home/user/data:/app/data:ro my-image
```

In this case, the `/app/data` directory inside the container will be mounted as **read-only**, meaning the container can read the data but cannot modify it.

### Benefits of Using Volumes
- **Persistence**: Data inside a container is lost when the container is removed, but data in volumes persists even when containers are stopped or removed.
- **Sharing Data Between Containers**: Volumes allow multiple containers to access and share the same data.
- **Easy Backup and Restore**: Volumes are easier to back up or restore because they're stored outside of the container filesystem.

### Listing and Inspecting Volumes
You can list all volumes on your system with:

```
docker volume ls
```

To get more details about a specific volume:

```
docker volume inspect <volume-name>
```
