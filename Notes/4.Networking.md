### Video Title: Understanding Docker Networks: Deploying MongoDB and Express

**Introduction**
- **Context**: The video continues a series on Docker, aimed at users who already have some familiarity with basic commands.
- **Focus**: This episode specifically addresses how to utilize Docker networks to run applications effectively, using MongoDB and Express as examples.

### Part 1: Running MongoDB

1. **Pulling the MongoDB Image**
   - **Command**: 
     ```bash
     docker pull mongo:4.4.6
     ```
   - **Explanation**: This command fetches a specific version of the MongoDB image from Docker Hub. Using a specific version ensures stability and compatibility, avoiding potential issues that may arise from using the latest image.

2. **Running the MongoDB Container**
   - **Command**:
     ```bash
     docker run -d -e MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME=root -e MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD=password -p 27017:27017 --name mongodb mongo:4.4.6
     ```
   - **Breakdown**:
     - `-d`: Runs the container in detached mode (in the background).
     - `-e`: Sets environment variables for MongoDB to create an initial root user with full privileges.
     - `-p`: Maps port 27017 of the host to port 27017 inside the container, allowing external access.
     - `--name`: Assigns a name to the container for easier reference.
   - **Result**: MongoDB is now running and can be accessed locally.

3. **Testing MongoDB Connection**
   - **Using MongoDB Compass**:
     - **Connection Details**:
       - Host: `localhost:27017`
       - Username: `root`
       - Password: `password`
   - **Result**: If the connection is successful, it confirms that MongoDB is operational and accessible.

### Part 2: Running Express

1. **Running the Express Container**
   - **Command**:
     ```bash
     docker run -d -e MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME=root -e MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD=password -e MONGO_URL=mongodb://root:password@localhost:27017 -p 8081:8081 --name express express
     ```
   - **Breakdown**:
     - Similar flags as MongoDB, but includes an additional `-e MONGO_URL` environment variable to specify the MongoDB connection string.
   - **Expected Outcome**: Express should start running on port 8081.

2. **Identifying Connection Issues**
   - **Checking Logs**:
     - **Command**: `docker logs <container_id>`
   - **Explanation**: This command retrieves logs for the specified container. If Express fails to connect, logs can provide insights into what went wrong.
   - **Common Issue**: If it shows that it cannot connect to MongoDB, it‚Äôs often due to using `localhost`.

3. **Connecting Containers via IP Address**
   - **Finding IP Address**:
     - **Command**: `docker inspect <container_id>`
   - **Example**: This command outputs detailed information about the MongoDB container, including its IP address.
   - **Revised Express Run Command**: Modify the command to use the MongoDB container‚Äôs IP instead of `localhost`.

### Part 3: Docker Networking

1. **Understanding Default Networks**
   - **Types**:
     - **Bridge**: Default network allowing container-to-container communication.
     - **Host**: Containers share the host's network stack.
     - **None**: Isolated; containers cannot access external networks.
   - **Example**: Containers on the bridge network can ping each other, while those on the none network cannot.

2. **Creating a Custom Bridge Network**
   - **Command**:
     ```bash
     docker network create my_custom_network
     ```
   - **Purpose**: A custom bridge network allows you to refer to containers by name.
   - **Running MongoDB and Express in Custom Network**:
     - MongoDB Command: 
       ```bash
       docker run -d --network=my_custom_network --name mongodb mongo:4.4.6
       ```
     - Express Command:
       ```bash
       docker run -d --network=my_custom_network --name express -e MONGO_URL=mongodb://root:password@mongodb:27017 -p 8081:8081 express
       ```
   - **Result**: Express can now refer to MongoDB using the container name `mongodb`.

3. **Accessing Containers by Name**
   - **How It Works**: Within the same custom network, containers can communicate using their names (e.g., `mongodb` instead of an IP).
   - **Result**: Simplifies configuration and increases reliability, as IP addresses can change.


Yes ‚Äî ‚úÖ **both containers must be on the same Docker network** in order to refer to each other by container name (like `mongodb` in `mongodb://root:password@mongodb:27017`).

---

### üîç Why?

Docker has a built-in DNS system, but **it only works inside a user-defined bridge network**. In that setup:

* Each container gets a hostname (its container name).
* Docker's internal DNS allows you to use `mongodb` as a hostname instead of an IP.

If they're on the same user-defined network, this will work:

```text
mongodb://root:password@mongodb:27017
```

But if they're on the **default bridge network**, DNS-based container name resolution **does not work reliably**.

---

### üõ†Ô∏è How to Ensure They're on the Same Network

#### Option 1: Create and use a user-defined network

```bash
docker network create mynet
```

Then run both containers using that network:

```bash
docker run -d --name mongodb --network mynet \
  -e MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME=root \
  -e MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD=password \
  mongo

docker run -d --name mongo-express --network mynet \
  -e ME_CONFIG_MONGODB_URL=mongodb://root:password@mongodb:27017 \
  -p 8081:8081 \
  mongo-express
```

---

#### Option 2: Use Docker Compose (recommended for multiple containers)

Compose automatically creates a shared network for all services:

```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  mongodb:
    image: mongo
    environment:
      MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME: root
      MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD: password

  mongo-express:
    image: mongo-express
    ports:
      - "8081:8081"
    environment:
      ME_CONFIG_MONGODB_URL: mongodb://root:password@mongodb:27017
    depends_on:
      - mongodb
```

### ‚úÖ Summary

> ‚úîÔ∏è **Yes, both containers need to be on the same Docker network** (preferably user-defined) to refer to each other by container name like `mongodb`.

### Part 4: Host Network

1. **Using Host Network**
   - **Command**:
     ```bash
     docker run --network=host alpine
     ```
   - **Explanation**: In host mode, the container shares the host's network interface, allowing it to access any resource the host can.
   - **Testing Access**: Inside the Alpine container, run:
     ```bash
     ping google.com
     ```
   - **Expected Outcome**: Successful ping indicates full network access, which can be useful for debugging or when you need high performance.
