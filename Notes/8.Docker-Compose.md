### Introduction to Docker Compose

**Docker Compose** allows you to define and run multi-container Docker applications. You can configure your services using a `docker-compose.yml` file.

### Key Components of a Docker Compose File

1. **Version**: Specifies the Compose file format version.
2. **Services**: Defines the different services (containers) you want to run.
3. **Networks**: Sets up custom networks for your containers to communicate.
4. **Volumes**: Manages persistent data for your services.

### Example `docker-compose.yml`

Here's a sample Compose file for a simple application with MongoDB and an Express.js service:

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  mongo:
    image: mongo
    container_name: mongo_db
    volumes:
      - mongo_data:/data/db
    networks:
      - app_network

  express:
    image: my_express_app
    container_name: express_app
    environment:
      - DB_HOST=mongo
      - DB_PORT=27017
    depends_on:
      - mongo
    networks:
      - app_network

volumes:
  mongo_data:

networks:
  app_network:
```

### Steps to Run the Application

1. **Create the `docker-compose.yml` file**:
   Save the above content into a file named `docker-compose.yml`.

2. **Build and Start the Services**:
   Run the following command in the terminal:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

3. **Check the Running Containers**:
   Use the command:
   ```bash
   docker-compose ps
   ```

4. **Stop and Remove Containers**:
   To stop and remove containers defined in your Compose file, run:
   ```bash
   docker-compose down
   ```

### Key Concepts

- **Environment Variables**: Used to configure services at runtime (e.g., database connection settings).
- **Volumes**: Essential for persisting data. In the example, `mongo_data` volume ensures MongoDB data is retained even if the container is removed.
- **Networks**: Simplifies communication between containers. The `app_network` allows the `express` service to communicate with `mongo`.

### Conclusion

Docker Compose streamlines the process of managing multiple containers. It allows you to define your application stack in a single file, making it easier to maintain and deploy.
