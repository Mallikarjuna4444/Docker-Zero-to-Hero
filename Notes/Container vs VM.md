**Overview of Containers vs. VMs:** Containers and virtual machines (VMs) both serve the purpose of isolating applications on a single platform, but they do so in fundamentally different ways.

**Traditional Deployment:** On a bare metal server, applications run on an OS, which includes a kernel for managing resources. For example, if you have two Java applications that require different versions of Java, conflicts can arise if the required versions are not installed simultaneously.

**Isolation with Containers:** To solve dependency issues, containers provide an isolated environment for each application using namespaces in the OS. This allows different applications to run simultaneously without resource conflicts.

**VM Architecture:** VMs use a hypervisor to create and manage virtual environments on top of a host OS. Each VM contains a guest OS, allowing different operating systems to run on the same hardware. For example, a Windows VM can run on a Linux host, but this setup is resource-intensive and incurs licensing costs.

**Container Architecture:** Containers, on the other hand, eliminate the need for a guest OS. Instead of a hypervisor, a container runtime manages the containers, which share the host OS. This design makes containers lightweight and faster to start, but also means that a container built for one OS cannot run on another (e.g., a Windows container cannot run on Linux).

**Key Differences:**
- **Size:** VMs are typically gigabytes in size; containers are only megabytes.
- **Speed:** VMs take time to create and boot, while containers can be started in seconds.
- **Resource Usage:** VMs consume a lot of system resources, whereas containers are much more efficient.

In essence, containers revolutionize how we deploy applications by providing a lightweight, fast, and efficient alternative to traditional virtual machines.
